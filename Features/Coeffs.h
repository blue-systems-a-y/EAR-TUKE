  * Class for computing delta coefficients. Internally contains circular buffer for frames coefficients
  * and computes delta coefs from this buffer. At the beginning and end of the recording duplicates first and last
  * frame vector respectively to always have the buffer full. At the beginning the buffer replicates first buffer to have
  * the buffer half full and reads the rest frames from input. At the end it replicates the last frame to the other
  * half of the buffer. This also means that this processor is delaying the output depending on the iWin parameter.
  * This also means that one call to the <i>getData</i> function triggers calling the same function of previous processor
  * multiple times.
  * The internal buffer holds number of frames equal to two times the window length plus one for which we are computing
  * the coefficients.
  * For example if the window length is 2 then:
  * v4 basic_coefs
  * v3 basic_coefs
  * v2 basic_coefs, delta_coefs = 1 * (v3 - v1) + 2 * (v4 - v0)
  * v1 basic_coefs
  * v0 basic_coefs
  *
  * the normalizing factor can be computed as norm = 2 * (1*1 + 2*2)
  * the new coefficients are appended to the original, basic coefficients
