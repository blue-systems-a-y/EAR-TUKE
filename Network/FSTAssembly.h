  * Transforming the acoustic model and dictionary to the finite state transducer network (FST).
  * The network can be output as native openFST format with index files or written in binary
  * format with all GMM specifications. For the proper work of the detection system the binary
  * format is mandatory.
  * FST is comprised from states and transitions between them. The transitions are created from the global
  * dictionary file and from acoustic model transition matrixes between individual states of event's models
  * Thus, the transition can hold probability that is result from the event's probability and transition probability
  * in the acoutic model.
